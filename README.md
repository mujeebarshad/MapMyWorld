# Map My World
This project is the SLAM project of the Udacity Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree. For the project, I applied the Real-Time Appearance Based Mapping (RTAB-Map) in ROS to perform SLAM in a simulated environment. See the writeup for an extended discussion of the theoretical content on SLAM algorithms and specifics of RTAB-Map.

## Installation & Build
### ROS Kinetic
The project was developed on Ubuntu 16.04 LTS with [ROS Kinetic](http://wiki.ros.org/kinetic), [Gazebo](http://gazebosim.org/) and [catkin](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin) installed.
